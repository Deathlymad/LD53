  - Oh, welcome to the gates of the city of Briedale!
  - "For being imprisoned for two years you look quite healthy! Didn\u2019t you catch
    a cold in the cells, Aye?"
  - Not much of a talker, are you? What's your name?
  - "Ohhh\u2026yeah I won\u2019t remember that anymore, people like you don\u2019t
    last long out there"
  - 'At least the guy before you didn''t. Got lost on his second night. Poor kid.
    He was really young. '
  - 'So, you are the city''s new lightbearer. I pity you! Have fun on the job though.
    Take this torch. '
  - ' It will light up the path before you, so you can see in the darkness of the
    woods. '
  - 'Anyway, you go, kid! Wanna take a toke? Aye? '
  - 'Sibannac! Soup is ready! '
  - Coming!
